Issue 1 : Server is not reachable or unable to connect Approach 
Solution :
#Ping the server by hostname and ip address
-> Hostname/IP Address is pingable
--> Issue might be on the client side as server is reachable
-> Hostname is not pingable but IP Address is pingable
--> Could be the DNS issue
---> check /etc/hosts
---> check /etc/hosts
---> check /etc/resolv.conf
---> check /etc/nsswitch.conf
---> (Optional) DNS can also be defined in the
 /etc/sysconfig/network-scripts/ifcfg-<interface>
-> Hostname/IP Address both are not pingable
--> Check the other server on its same network to see if there is Network side access issue or other overall something bad
---> False: Issue is not overall network side but its with that host/server
---> True: Might be overall network side issue
--> Logged into server by Virtual Console, if the server is PoweredON. Check the uptime
--> Check if the server has the IP, and has UP status of Network interface
---> (Optional) Also check IP related information from
  /etc/sysconfig/network-scripts/ifcfg-<interface>
--> Ping the gateway, also check routes
--> Check Selinux, Firewall rules
--> Check physical cable conn

Issue 2 : Unable to connect to website or an application Approach 
Solution :
-> Ping the server by Hostname and IP Address
-> False: Above Troublshooting Diagram “Server is not reachable or cannot connect”
-> True: Check the service availabilty by using telnet command with port
-->  True: Service is running
-->  False: Service is not reachable or running
--->   Check the service status using systemctl or other command
--->   Check the firewall/selinux
--->   Check the service logs
--->   Check the service configuration

Issue 4 : Disk Space is full issue or add/extend disk space Approach / 
Solution :

├── System Performance degradation detection

│ ├── Application getting slow/unresponsive

│ ├── Commands are not running (For Example: as / disk space is full)

│ ├── Cannot do logging and other etc

├── Analyse the issue

│ ├── df command to find the problematic filesystem space issue

├── Action

│ ├── After finding the specific filesystem, use du command in that filesystem to get which files/directories are large

│ ├── Compress/remove big files

│ ├── Move the items to another partition/server

│ ├── Check the health status of the disks using badblocks command (For Example: #badblocks -v /dev/sda)

│ ├── Check which process is IO Bound (using iostat)

│ ├── Create a link to file/dir

├── New disk addition

│ ├── Simple partition

│ │ ├── Add disk to VM

│ │ ├── Check the new disk with df/lsblk command

│ │ ├── fdisk to create partition. Better to have LVM partition

│ │ ├── Create filesytem and mount it

│ │ ├── fstab entry for persistent

│ ├── LVM Partition

│ │ ├── Add disk to VM

│ │ ├── Check the new disk with df/lsblk command

│ │ ├── fdisk to create LVM partition

│ │ ├── PV, VG, LV

│ │ ├── Create filesytem and mount it

│ │ ├── fstab entry for persistent

│ ├── Extend LVM partition

│ │ ├── Add disk, and create LVM partition

│ │ ├── Add LVM partition (PV) in existing VG

│ │ ├── Extend LV and resize filesystem
