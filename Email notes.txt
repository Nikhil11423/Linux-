Edit the crontab entries using crontab -e command (by default this will edit the current logged-in users crontab) and add the following line:

0 0 * * 1,3,5 $HOME/scripts/send_email.sh >> $HOME/tmp/out 2>&1
Now you should create send_email.sh script. Something like this:

#!/bin/bash

recipients="user0@domain.com user1@domain.com user2@domain.com"
subject="...Subject..."

cat $HOME/email_message | mail -s $subject $recipients
$HOME/email_message is the message (file) you want to send.

Don't forget to grant execute access for the script:

chmod +x $HOME/scripts/send_email.sh

Incoming mail is not affected, except that you have remember to to open the appropriate ports (TCP 25, 110, 143, 465, 587, 993, 995)
