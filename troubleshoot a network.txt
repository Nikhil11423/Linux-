There are a few steps you can take to troubleshoot a network of computers that are unable to connect to the internet:

**Check the cables and connections.** Make sure that all cables are securely plugged in and that there are no loose connections.

**Restart the router.** Unplug the router, wait a few seconds, and then plug it back in. This can often resolve connectivity issues.

**Check the router's settings.** Make sure that the router is configured correctly and that the network is set up properly.

**Check the IP addresses.** Make sure that all computers on the network have unique IP addresses and that they are correctly configured.

**Check for software updates.** Make sure that all computers on the network have the latest software and security updates installed.

**Check for malware.** Make sure that all computers on the network are free from malware or other security threats.

**Check the DNS settings.** Make sure that the DNS settings on the network are correct.

**Contact the ISP.** If none of the above steps resolve the issue, contact your internet service provider for assistance.
